# Chicago Style Checker

An experimental academic writing tool for **technical and stylistic revisions**
aligned with the *Chicago Manual of Style (17th edition)*.

This project focuses on formal issues such as punctuation, capitalization,
citation phrasing, and consistency.  
It does **not** evaluate or revise substantive content or arguments.
